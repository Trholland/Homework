# Tory Holland

##  My name is Tory Holland, prior to this course I attended college for 3D Animation. While I still love animation and modeling, I decided to step away from that to learn coding. I enjoy gaming and reading in my free time.

My goals for this course:
- Learn all I can about Python, as I find it to be interesting
- Learn the necessary skills for data analytics
- Get a job in the field
- Develop a solid base for Python, SQL, Excel, etc.

An article I find interesting is ["Python AI: Why Is Python So Good for Machine Learning?"](https://www.netguru.com/blog/python-machine-learning). I find this article interesting as it details using Python in AI development, which I find to be facinating.

This is an image of a twitch streamer known as Vedal987, specifically his model. I have chosen this image as it's what he has created that sort of introduced me to the possibilities of Python. Most notably, Vedal987 created an AI that is fully capable of streaming and even interacting with the chat. He continuously works on it, improving things such as it's speech, interactions, and response time.
